# MODAL enrichment

This set of scripts was created as a deliverable for the [project MODAL](https://advn.be/nl/over-advn/projecten/modal-project).

The research project "Metadata and Access to Digital Archives Using Large Language Models," or MODAL for short, launched in the fall of 2024. MODAL's goal is to investigate the potential applications of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for the cultural heritage sector and to disseminate this knowledge within the sector.

This a part of a suite of scripts:

* [scripts for text extraction and metadata storage](https://github.com/hvanstappen/MODAL_textdatabase/)
* scripts for enrichments (this set of scripts)
* [scripts for browsing and retrieval of documents]()
